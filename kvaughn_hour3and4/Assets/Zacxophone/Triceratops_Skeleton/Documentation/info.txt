Hey, thank you so much for downloading my Triceratops!

This is a beautiful scan Licenced under CC0 Public Domain that I found on Sketchfab made by The Smithsonian Institution.
https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/triceratops-horridus-marsh-e9c507f179ed4455aac3b208c9e6c973

I spent a couple of days cleaning and rigging the mesh to be able to animate it. 

This asset contains 1 rigged, textured and animated Triceratops

This project supports 3 render pipelines (Built-in, URP and HDRP), so I had to make some concessions and tidy up the project accordingly. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Import:
Check all the files you need and the correct pipeline folder. uncheck the two other pipeline folder to proprely import it

Animation:
This model is supplied with 6 animations:
- Idle
- Rise Up
- Roar
- Roar To walk transition
- walk 
- fall

You can find all the animations directly inside the Triceratops fbx file contained in the "Meshes" folder
I also added an animator example (Inside the "DemoAnimator" folder) that loops between all animations.

Materials and textures:
1 material made up of 4 textures (2048px):
- Albedo
- Ambient Occlusion
- Metallic Smoothness
- Normal map

(plus the HDRP MaskMap)

You will also find a demo scene featuring the Triceratops and the animator

Thank you again, if you have any questions feel free to contact me by email or Instagram
